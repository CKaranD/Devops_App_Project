New Menu Scheme, Dear Zurista,We are pleased to inform you that Tech Team has come out with a new menu scheme in Xilnex and it is scheduled to be released on 1st June. This change has been carefully crafted to enhance Zurista experience, and provide streamline operations.The new menu scheme introduces several updates and improvements that we believe will greatly benefit our operation efficiency and effectiveness. We kindly request that relevant person familiarizes themselves with the changes to ensure a smooth transition and consistent communication across the board.Here are the key updates and enhancements included in the new menu scheme:Changes 1:The modifiers displayed for each drink are specific to that particular drink. This means that you will only see the available modifiers that can be applied to that drink.For example, let's consider Drink A. If the only available modifier for Drink A is 'Coffee Jelly', then that is the only option you will see in the modifier section. You won't see any other options like 'Velvet Creme' because it is not applicable to Drink A. Each drink has its own set of modifiers, ensuring that you can customize your order based on the available options for that specific drink. Perubahan 1:Modifier yang dipaparkan untuk setiap minuman adalah khusus untuk minuman tersebut. Jadi, anda hanya akan melihat modifier yang boleh digunakan untuk minuman tersebut.Contohnya, mari kita ambil Minuman A sebagai contoh. Jika hanya terdapat modifier 'Coffee Jelly' yang boleh ditambah pada Minuman A, maka hanya itulah pilihan yang akan anda lihat di bahagian modifier. Anda tidak akan melihat pilihan lain seperti 'Velvet Creme' kerana ia tidak sesuai untuk Minuman A. Setiap minuman mempunyai modifier yang tersendiri, membolehkan anda menyesuaikan pesanan berdasarkan pilihan yang ada untuk minuman tersebut.____________________________________________________________________________Changes 2:Certain modifiers have a restriction of allowing only one selection at a time. This limitation applies to modifiers such as "Milk Alternative," where you can choose from various milk bases.For example, when customizing a drink, you can select only one milk base from the available options. This ensures that the chosen modifier serves its intended purpose effectively and avoids any confusion or conflicting combinations. Perubahan 2:Terdapat beberapa modifier yang hanya membenarkan satu pilihan pada satu masa. Ini berlaku untuk modifier seperti "Alternatif Susu," di mana anda hanya boleh memilih satu jenis susu sahaja.Sebagai contoh, semasa anda menyesuaikan minuman, anda hanya boleh memilih satu jenis susu daripada pilihan yang tersedia. Ini memastikan modifier yang dipilih berfungsi dengan baik dan mengelakkan sebarang kekeliruan atau kombinasi yang tidak sesuai.____________________________________________________________________________Changes 3:There is no limit to the quantity of certain modifiers based on the product team's standard. This means that customers can request and add as many of these modifiers as they want to their drink.For example, if a customer wants to add extra shots to their beverage, they can do so without any restrictions. You are able to customize their order by selecting multiple shots according to their preference. Perubahan 3:Ada modifier tertentu yang tidak terhad mengikut standard pasukan produk. Ini bermakna pelanggan boleh meminta dan menambah modifier tersebut sebanyak yang mereka inginkan ke dalam minuman mereka.Sebagai contoh, jika pelanggan ingin menambahkan shot tambahan ke dalam minuman mereka, mereka boleh melakukannya tanpa sebarang sekatan. Anda boleh menyesuaikan pesanan mereka dengan memilih banyak shot mengikut kehendak mereka.____________________________________________________________________________Changes 4:When it comes to modifiers like sweetness, ice level, and temperature, we have default selections based on our standard recipe. These default choices won't be displayed on the left side of the menu.However, if a customer selects a different option for any of these modifiers, the chosen option will appear on the left side of the menu (and also be printed on the receipt). This way, customers can easily see and confirm their specific preferences for sweetness, ice level, and temperature when they deviate from the default selection. Perubahan 4:Untuk modifier seperti kemanisan, tahap ais, dan suhu, kita ada pilihan lalai berdasarkan resipi standard. Tapi pilihan-pilihan lalai ini takkan dipaparkan di sebelah kiri menu.Tapi kalau pelanggan pilih pilihan yang lain untuk modifier-modifier ni, pilihan yang dipilih tu akan keluar di sebelah kiri menu (dan akan dicetak dalam resit). Jadi pelanggan boleh nampak dengan jelas dan sahkan pilihan kemanisan, tahap ais, dan suhu yang dikehendaki kalau dia tak ikut pilihan lalai.____________________________________________________________________________*Kindly note that these changes are also implemented for the outlets participating in the “Dual Bean Project”.*With the new organized menu, we strongly encourage Zurista to proactively promote and upsell the menu items (modifiers) to our valued customers.-ZUSTECH- , .
